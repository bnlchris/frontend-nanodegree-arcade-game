# Udacity's Classic Arcade Game Frogger

## About the project

This is the fourth project in Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program. Students were obliged to show their proficieny in working with object-oriented programming (JavaScript).

To prove this, one must complete a classic arcade game, Frogger.

## How to play?

The player has to reach the water five times. But beware of the ugly bugs crossing the street from left to right. When touching one of them, the player loses one of three lives (the hearts above).

## How do you load the game?

You can either play the game online, using this [version on Github](https://improvingsoftware.com/2011/06/27/5-best-practices-for-commenting-your-code/).

If you want to play this game locally, feel free to download this folder. Clone the project with (https://github.com/bnlchris/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git). Then, start the game by opening index.html

## My contributions

As a Udacity student, I had to complete the class of the bugs and create a new player class from scratch. I also had to write the code for the collision detection and the other functions ruling the game.
